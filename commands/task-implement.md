## üß† ULTRATHINK Process

### üîç Step 0: Context7 Documentation Research [CRITICAL]
**IMPORTANT**: Before writing ANY code:
- [ ] **Use Context7** to investigate the latest documentation for ALL technologies involved
- [ ] Check for recent API changes, deprecations, or best practices updates
- [ ] Verify version compatibility and known issues
- [ ] Document findings in a research log

> **THINK**: Documentation changes frequently. What worked yesterday might be deprecated today.

### üéØ Step 1: TDD Planning Phase [ULTRATHINK Required]
**Write tests BEFORE implementation:**

```
1. Define Test Scenarios:
   [ ] Happy path test cases
   [ ] Edge case test cases
   [ ] Error handling test cases
   [ ] Performance test cases

2. Create Test Structure:
   Given: [Initial state]
   When: [Action taken]
   Then: [Expected outcome]
```

**IMPORTANT**: No code until tests are written!

### üèõÔ∏è Step 1.5: Design Pattern Analysis [Gang of Four]
**ULTRATHINK**: Consider which classic design patterns apply to your solution.

#### Creational Patterns (Object Creation)
- [ ] **Singleton**: Ensure only one instance of a class exists
- [ ] **Factory Method**: Define interface for creating objects, let subclasses decide which to instantiate
- [ ] **Abstract Factory**: Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes
- [ ] **Builder**: Separate complex object construction from representation
- [ ] **Prototype**: Create objects by cloning existing instances

#### Structural Patterns (Object Composition)
- [ ] **Adapter**: Allow incompatible interfaces to work together
- [ ] **Bridge**: Separate abstraction from implementation
- [ ] **Composite**: Compose objects into tree structures for part-whole hierarchies
- [ ] **Decorator**: Add new functionality to objects dynamically
- [ ] **Facade**: Provide simplified interface to complex subsystem
- [ ] **Flyweight**: Share objects efficiently for large quantities of similar objects
- [ ] **Proxy**: Provide placeholder/surrogate for another object

#### Behavioral Patterns (Object Collaboration)
- [ ] **Chain of Responsibility**: Pass requests along a chain of handlers
- [ ] **Command**: Encapsulate requests as objects
- [ ] **Interpreter**: Define grammar and interpreter for a language
- [ ] **Iterator**: Access elements of collection sequentially without exposing implementation
- [ ] **Mediator**: Define how objects interact without explicit references
- [ ] **Memento**: Capture and restore object's internal state
- [ ] **Observer**: Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- [ ] **State**: Allow object to alter behavior when internal state changes
- [ ] **Strategy**: Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- [ ] **Template Method**: Define algorithm skeleton, subclasses override specific steps
- [ ] **Visitor**: Define new operations without changing classes of elements operated on

**THINK**: Which patterns solve your problem while maintaining KISS principles?

### üî¨ Step 2: KISS Analysis [Critical Thinking Required]
**ULTRATHINK** about simplicity:
- [ ] Can this be done in fewer steps?
- [ ] Are we over-engineering?
- [ ] What's the simplest solution that passes all tests?
- [ ] Document complexity vs. simplicity tradeoffs

**Remember**: The best code is no code. The second best is simple code.

### üèóÔ∏è Step 3: Implementation Strategy Matrix

| Approach | Complexity | Testability | Maintainability | Performance | KISS Score | Design Pattern |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Option A | Low/Med/High | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | Pattern Name |
| Option B | Low/Med/High | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | Pattern Name |
| Option C | Low/Med/High | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | Pattern Name |

**THINK**: Always favor high KISS scores unless performance is critical. Consider if patterns add value or complexity.

### üí° Step 4: Critical Evaluation Checklist
**ULTRATHINK** before proceeding:
- [ ] Have I checked Context7 for the latest docs?
- [ ] Are my tests comprehensive?
- [ ] Is this the simplest solution?
- [ ] Have I considered all edge cases?
- [ ] Will a junior developer understand this?
- [ ] Am I using design patterns appropriately (not over-engineering)?
- [ ] Do the chosen patterns align with KISS principles?

### üîÑ Step 5: Zen Review Protocol
**IMPORTANT**: At 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completion:
1. **Use Zen** to review your work in progress
2. Ask Zen:
   - "Is this following TDD principles?"
   - "Can this be simpler? (KISS check)"
   - "What edge cases am I missing?"
   - "Is this maintainable?"
   - "Are design patterns used appropriately or am I over-engineering?"
   - "Would a different pattern be simpler?"
3. Document Zen's feedback
4. Iterate based on insights

### üìù Step 6: Implementation Execution

#### Phase 1: Red Phase (TDD)
- [ ] Write failing tests
- [ ] Verify tests fail for the right reasons
- [ ] Document expected behaviors

#### Phase 2: Green Phase (TDD)
- [ ] Write MINIMAL code to pass tests
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Resist adding features not required by tests
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

#### Phase 3: Refactor Phase (TDD)
- [ ] Simplify code (KISS)
- [ ] Remove duplication
- [ ] Improve naming
- [ ] Ensure tests still pass

### üé® Step 7: Code Quality Gates
**ULTRATHINK** - Each function must pass:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Does one thing well
2. **Testability**: Can be tested in isolation
3. **Readability**: Self-documenting code
4. **KISS Compliance**: No unnecessary complexity
5. **Context7 Alignment**: Follows latest best practices

### üö® Step 8: Critical Checkpoints

#### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Context7 documentation reviewed
- [ ] TDD test suite prepared
- [ ] KISS approach validated
- [ ] Zen consulted on approach

#### Mid-Implementation
- [ ] Tests driving development
- [ ] Complexity kept minimal
- [ ] Regular Zen reviews (25%, 50%, 75%)
- [ ] Documentation up-to-date

#### Post-Implementation
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code follows KISS principle
- [ ] Final Zen review completed
- [ ] Context7 best practices verified

### üìä Step 9: Metrics & Validation

**IMPORTANT** - Measure success:
```
Test Coverage: ___% (Target: >90%)
Cyclomatic Complexity: ___ (Target: <10)
Lines per Function: ___ (Target: <20)
KISS Compliance: ___/10
Zen Approval: ___/10
```

### üéØ Step 10: Definition of Done
**ULTRATHINK** - Not done until:
- [ ] All tests pass (TDD ‚úì)
- [ ] Code is simple (KISS ‚úì)
- [ ] Context7 best practices followed
- [ ] Zen review approved
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Code ready for junior developer

## üß∞ Pro Tips & Tricks

### The 2-Minute Rule
**THINK**: If it takes more than 2 minutes to understand a function, it's too complex.

### The Rubber Duck Protocol
Before asking for help:
1. Explain your code to a rubber duck
2. Use Zen as your digital rubber duck
3. Often, you'll find the answer yourself

### The Future-You Test
**IMPORTANT**: Will you understand this code in 6 months? If not, simplify or document.

### The Deletion Test
**ULTRATHINK**: What can you delete and still have working code? Delete it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders

1. **ALWAYS** check Context7 first - outdated docs = wasted time
2. **NEVER** write code before tests (TDD is non-negotiable)
3. **CONSTANTLY** ask "Can this be simpler?" (KISS)
4. **REGULARLY** use Zen for code reviews
5. **THINK** critically about every design decision
6. **ULTRATHINK** about maintainability and readability

**IMPORTANT**: This quote embodies KISS. Meditate on it. Live it. Code it.
